## üìÅ Problems by Topic

### Arrays (6 problems)

#### Day 1 (Oct 27, 2024)
1. **Second Largest Element in Array**
   - File: `arrays/day1-second-largest.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach: Track largest and second largest in one pass
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

2. **Count Odd Element**
   - File: `arrays/day1-Count-odd.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach: Single-pass for-loop over the array indices.
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

3. **Sum of Array**
   - File: `arrays/day1-sumOf-array.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach: Single-pass for-loop over the array indices.
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

#### Day 2 (Oct 28, 2024)
3. **Check if Array is Sorted**
   - File: `arrays/day2-is-sorted.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach: Compare each element with next
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
   - File: `arrays/day2-Remove-duplicate.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach:1- In-place removal (nested loops)
              2- Set-based (unique array)
              3- two pointer
   - Time:1- O(n*2), Space: O(1)
          2- O(n), Space: O(n)
          3- O(n), space: O(1)

5. **Reversing Array**
   - File: `arrays/day2-Reverse-array.js`
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Approach: Two-pointer in-place swap
   - Time:1- O(n), space:O(1)


   #### Day 2 (Oct 28, 2024)

6. **Rotate array**
   - File: `arrays/day3-Rotate-Array.js`
   - Difficulty: medium
   - Approach: 1= using extra array
               2= reverse method (using two pointer)
   - Time:1= O(n), Space: O(n)
          2= O(n), Space: O(1)

6. **Move Zeros**
   - File: `arrays/day3-Move-Zero.js`
   - Difficulty: easy
   - Approach: 1= using Two Pointer
              
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)


## üéØ Learning Notes

### Array Patterns Learned:
- Single pass iteration for finding max/min
- single pass for-loop over the array indices
- Two pointers technique for in-place operations(for duplicate,reverse)
- Compare each element with next using for loop(checking sort)
